## Project Description

- Build microservices that simulate key financial operations Stone might be interested in:

    1. Transaction Service: Processes financial transactions (e.g., payments, transfers).
    2. Account Service: Manages user accounts, balances, and transaction history.
    3. Fraud Detection Service: Analyzes transactions in real-time for fraud patterns.
    4. Notification Service: Sends alerts and notifications for key events (e.g., successful transactions, suspicious activities).

- Implement financial-grade security measures, such as:

    - Encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for message integrity.
    - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for user authentication.

- Use idempotency to ensure that financial operations are not executed more than once, which is critical in payment processing systems.

- Ensure ACID compliance in database transactions, especially for the Account Service, to maintain consistency during concurrent operations.

- Integrate with external APIs for exchange rates, payment gateways, or other financial services (even if simulated).

## Key Aspects to Highlight

1. Security: Implement industry-standard security practices such as OAuth2 for API authentication, encryption, and rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
2. Data Consistency: Ensure that all transactions are atomic and consistent. This could involve eventual consistency in a distributed setup or strict transactional integrity for critical services.
3. High Availability & Fault Tolerance: Use patterns like circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to ensure that the system can handle failures gracefully.
4. Scalability: Demonstrate horizontal scaling for services like Transaction Processing. Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to decouple services and allow for load balancing.
5. Monitoring & Alerts: Implement detailed logging, tracing, and alerting. Focus on financial metrics like transaction failures, processing times, and fraud detection triggers.
6. Compliance: Incorporate practices that simulate real-world regulatory requirements, such as audit logging for transactions and GDPR-style data management.

Example Technologies:

- Database: PostgreSQL with ACID transactions.
- Caching: Redis for caching user sessions and frequently accessed data.
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous transaction processing.
- API Documentation: Swagger for API documentation to show clear contract definitions, which is crucial in financial applications.
- CI/CD: Demonstrate continuous deployment pipelines with automated testing, perhaps using GitHub Actions.
